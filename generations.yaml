generations:
  - name: "First Generation (R53)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The original John Cooper Works offerings for MINI began as dealer-installed tuning kits developed by John Cooper Garages, bearing the name of the legendary creator of the original Mini Cooper. These kits upgraded the supercharged 1.6-liter engine in the Cooper S with a modified cylinder head, different supercharger pulley, and performance exhaust system, boosting output from 163-170 horsepower to approximately 200 horsepower. In 2006, MINI offered a limited-production factory model called the Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit (commonly known as the 'GP'), restricted to 2,000 units worldwide. The GP featured a dedicated 218 horsepower engine, lightweight components including an aluminum rear suspension and carbon fiber rear spoiler, deletion of the rear seats, and exclusive chassis modifications including adjustable coilover suspension. Distinctive visual elements included unique Thunder Blue metallic paint with red mirrors, custom 18-inch wheels, aerodynamic modifications, and special badging. The GP established the ultimate expression of the JCW ethos, combining increased performance with weight reduction and focused dynamics, setting a pattern for future special JCW models. These early JCW models, particularly the GP, have become highly collectible, representing the purest expression of the first modern MINI's sporting capabilities."

  - name: "Second Generation (R56)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation saw John Cooper Works transformed from a tuning kit into a fully integrated model within the MINI lineup, managed entirely by MINI rather than John Cooper Garages. The JCW model launched in 2008 featured a substantially upgraded version of the Cooper S's turbocharged 1.6-liter engine, producing 208 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque (207 lb-ft with overboost). Enhanced with unique pistons, strengthened components, and a larger turbocharger, it was paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. The chassis received comprehensive modifications including stiffer suspension tuning, larger brakes with red calipers, and an electronic differential lock system. Distinctive styling elements included aerodynamic body modifications, unique 17-inch wheels, and specific badging. The interior featured sport seats, a thicker steering wheel, and JCW-specific instrumentation. The JCW versions expanded beyond the Hardtop to include Clubman, Convertible, Coupe, and Roadster body styles. In 2013, a second-generation JCW GP model was introduced, limited to 2,000 units worldwide. The GP2 featured a 218 horsepower engine, adjustable coilover suspension, powerful braking system, lightweight 17-inch wheels, aerodynamic body kit, and rear seat deletion. Unlike the first GP, the GP2 was available in either Thunder Grey or Chili Red. This generation established JCW as MINI's dedicated performance sub-brand with a comprehensive model range rather than simply an aftermarket upgrade."

  - name: "Third Generation (F56/F55/F57/F54/F60)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The third-generation JCW models represented the most substantial performance upgrades yet, transitioning to a BMW-developed 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine initially producing 228 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torqueâ€”significantly more than previous JCW versions. This engine received a major update in 2019 for the Clubman and Countryman JCW models, increasing output to 301 horsepower and 331 lb-ft, making them the most powerful production MINIs ever at the time. The JCW was available across most MINI body styles including the Hardtop (2-door and 4-door), Convertible, Clubman, and Countryman, the latter two offering ALL4 all-wheel drive. Transmission options expanded to include an 8-speed automatic alongside the 6-speed manual, with the high-output models available exclusively with the automatic. The chassis featured model-specific suspension tuning, larger brakes with 4-piston front calipers, and enhanced cooling systems. Distinctive styling elements included aggressive aerodynamic body kits, unique wheel designs, and red accents throughout the exterior and interior. Inside, JCW models received sport seats with integrated headrests, JCW steering wheel, and performance-oriented displays. In 2020, the limited-production JCW GP3 debuted as the most extreme MINI yet, featuring a 302 horsepower engine, radical aerodynamic modifications including a distinctive rear wing, widened fenders, lightweight 18-inch wheels, and track-focused suspension. Limited to 3,000 units worldwide, the GP3 was offered exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission and two-seat configuration. This generation elevated the JCW sub-brand to new performance heights while expanding its appeal across the MINI model range."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (J01)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation John Cooper Works models adopt MINI's new minimalist design language while maintaining the performance sub-brand's focus on enhanced sporting capability. Initially available on the Hardtop, the new JCW features the brand's cleanest styling in recent years, with simplified surfaces, more subtle aerodynamic elements, and distinctive lighting signatures. Performance comes from an updated version of BMW's 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing approximately 228 horsepower, paired with either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch transmission depending on market. The chassis receives comprehensive upgrades including stiffer suspension tuning, larger brakes with red calipers, and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Visually differentiated from standard MINI models by a model-specific body kit with larger air intakes, side skirts, rear diffuser, and optional bonnet stripes. The interior adopts MINI's new minimalist approach centered around a large circular OLED touchscreen, complemented by JCW-specific digital displays, sport seats with integrated headrests, and red accents throughout. While the new JCW maintains the brand's focus on handling and driver engagement, it introduces a more sophisticated, premium character in line with MINI's upmarket positioning. The Countryman JCW continues with a more powerful engine, producing approximately 296 horsepower and featuring all-wheel drive as standard. An electric JCW variant is expected in the future, translating the sub-brand's performance focus to MINI's expanding electric lineup. The fourth-generation JCW models aim to balance MINI's sporting heritage with contemporary design, technology, and a measured approach to performance that emphasizes driver engagement over raw statistics."
